It runs simulations to determine the optimal state of the system, then performs a delta analysis comparing the current state to the desired one. At that point, it publishes a set of parameters tailored to every element of the biorome, enabling the Operations Engine to assign precise tasks to the robotic modules to achieve the optimal state.",
